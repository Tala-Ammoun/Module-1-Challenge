# HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description

In the bootcamo this week, my Challenge was to improve a website's accessibility. I was required to take existing code and refactor it to make it more accessible.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this code refactor, you can review the HTML and CSS files above. To view the coding of the HTML and CSS files directly from the live web page, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see what semantic elements I added to the HTML page, and how I chronologically linked them to the CSS sheet.

You can find the link to the deployed page here:
